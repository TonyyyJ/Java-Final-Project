We are using 163 email as a test incicator of this project. 163 Mailbox is a free e-mail service provided by NetEase, mainly for the Chinese market. 

We chose 163 email because its POP3 service is easy to access. 

For Host, please the POP3 server:pop.163.com.

For Username, please use:yydeng_0490@163.com, it's the eamil we used for this project.

For password, please use the the third-party authorization password we got from the server:HIOQBGFNUIXFKZBZ.

The terminal will also show the progress of email, how many percentage of emails have been processed, and the time used to process all the emails.
